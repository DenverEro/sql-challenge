# Pewlett Hackard Employee Database Project

## Overview

This project involves designing, implementing, and analyzing a database for Pewlett Hackard, a fictional company. The database contains historical employee data from the 1980s and 1990s, stored in six CSV files. The project is divided into three main parts: data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.

## Project Structure

1. **Data Modeling**:
    - Inspect CSV files and create an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD).
    - Define table schemas for each CSV file.

2. **Data Engineering**:
    - Create SQL tables based on the defined schemas.
    - Import data from CSV files into the SQL database.
    - Ensure correct data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints.

3. **Data Analysis**:
    - Perform various SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from the data, including:
        - Listing employee details and salaries.
        - Identifying employees hired in 1986.
        - Finding department managers and their details.
        - Analyzing employee department affiliations.
        - Searching for specific employees by name patterns.
        - Counting employees in specific departments.
        - Calculating the frequency of employee last names.
